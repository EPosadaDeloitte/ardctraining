# ardctraining evaluation

This project takes care in tackling a couple of user stories to implement for an electronics store, in particular to store and manage feedbacks sent from customers.

## Customer User Story
As a Customer, I want to be able to send feedback to systemadministrators to let them know about issues or to suggest improvements in the storefront or to 
congratulate about the features included in it.

## Business User Story
As a SystemAdministrator, I want to see in Backoffice the feedbacks submitted by customers in the storefront, to read them and mark them as read.
